{"name":"RBS Raspberry Pi Club","tagline":"Wormy Hack 1: The Wall","body":"### Welcome to the RBS Raspberry Pi Club\r\nOur volunteers have been running Raspberry Pi programming clubs at local schools for 2 years, and over that time, we've come up with lots of great programming exercises that can be completed in about an hour.  \r\n\r\nA great variety of topics are covered in a fun way, you don't really need any prior programming experience to try them (but a bit of familiarity with your Raspberry Pi helps).  We generally try to avoid anything that requires extra hardware or network connectivity (those aren't always easy to organise in school).\r\n\r\n## Exercises\r\n[Wormy Hack 1: The Wall](wormy1.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
