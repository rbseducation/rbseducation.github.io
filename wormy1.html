<p>In this first exercise, we're going to be working on some alterations ("hacks") to the Wormy game that you'll find pre-installed on the standard Raspbian distribution for your Raspberry Pi.  It's a version of the Nibbles/Snake game written by Al Sweigart, and we're going to have some fun with it.</p>

<h2>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Hopefully, you've already got started with your Raspberry Pi, and have got it running with the standard Raspbian distro and know where to find the Python Games that come with that.  For this exercise, you're going to be doing a <em>hack</em> to make some fun changes to the <code>wormy.py</code> program.  Make sure you've got a back up copy of first.  At a terminal, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd python_games
$ cp wormy.py original_wormy.py
$ ls *.py
</code></pre>

<p>In UNIX, the <code>cd</code> command changes into a directory (folder), and the <code>cp</code> command copies a file.  That last <code>ls</code> bit lists of all the .py files.  Check you've got <code>wormy.py</code> and <code>original_wormy.py</code>.  Now you have a backup copy of the original that you can always to back to if you need to!</p>

<h2>
<a name="starting-simple" class="anchor" href="#starting-simple"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting Simple</h2>

<p>Try some basic hacks in <code>wormy.py</code> first.  Open IDLE (the icon is on the desktop) and then open the wormy.py file.</p>

<p>Try changing the colour of the apple to Pink (Pink Lady?).  Hint: have a look for the below part of the code and try changing the colour.  Press F5 to run your code.  </p>

<pre><code>def drawApple(coord):
    ...
    pygame.draw.rect(DISPLAYSURF, RED, appleRect)
</code></pre>

<p>Did the colour change, or did you get an error?  You probably got an error like this:</p>

<pre><code>error goes here
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so let's fix that.  Python doesn't know what <code>PINK</code> is, but it clearly knows what <code>RED</code> is.  Look near the top of of the code for this section:</p>

<pre><code>#             R    G    B
WHITE     = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK     = (  0,   0,   0)
RED       = (255,   0,   0)
...
</code></pre>

<p>That section of code is defining the colours that are used in the game.  All colours are defined by a combination of Red, Green and Blue.  And the amount of each colour used ranges from 0 to 256 (so the total number of possible colours is 256 * 256 * 256 = 16 million colours!).  So we need to define PINK.  Pink is a combination of all three, but lots of red.  So let's use:</p>

<pre><code>#             R    G    B
WHITE     = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK     = (  0,   0,   0)
RED       = (255,   0,   0)
PINK      = (255, 105, 180)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Add that new line into your code and run again with F5.  This time, if you've done everything right, the apple should be Hot Pink!</p>

<p>Next, let's try changing the speed of the game to make it harder or easier to play.  Find this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>        pygame.display.update()
        FPSCLOCK.tick(FPS)
</code></pre>

<p>This is right at the bottom of the main 'loop' of the game.  The game loop runs continuously, responding to any key-press the player makes, updates the position of the worm, checks if it's eaten the apple or hit its tail or the edge, and then redraws the screen to reflect that.  Then the last thing it does is wait for a few milliseconds.  If it didn't the worm would move so fast it'd be impossible to play.  Try commenting out the <code>FPSCLOCK.tick(FPS)</code> line (put a <code>#</code> in front of it so that Python ignores it) and run the game again to see just how fast...</p>

<p>Once you've done that, uncomment that line again.  Now, that <code>FPS</code> part in the parenthesis is telling the program how long to wait in each cycle.  It stands for <em>Frames Per Second</em>.  At the top of the program, you will find this:</p>

<pre><code>FPS = 15
</code></pre>

<p>Try using different values there to see the impact it has on the speed of the game.  </p>

<a name="start-building-the-wall" class="anchor" href="#start-building-the-wall"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Start Building the Wall</h2>

<p>First, we'll going to add a simple one-brick wall to the game.  Find the first two lines below which are already in the programe, and add the part below in bold right after it:</p>

<pre><code>    # Start the apple in a random place.
    apple = getRandomLocation()

    firstBrickX = 20
    firstBrickY = 10
    wallCoords = [{'x': firstBrickX, 'y': firstBrickY}]

</code></pre>

<p>Next, we're going to steal the code that draws the apple, and reuse it to draw our single-brick wall.   Find this bit of code which is already there:</p>

<pre><code>def drawApple(coord):
    x = coord['x'] * CELLSIZE
    y = coord['y'] * CELLSIZE
    appleRect = pygame.Rect(x, y, CELLSIZE, CELLSIZE)
    pygame.draw.rect(DISPLAYSURF, RED, appleRect)
</code></pre>

<p>Make a copy of that code right below it (leave at least one blank line) and make the below changes to it (changes highlighted in bold):</p>

<pre><code>def drawWall(wallCoords):
    for coord in wallCoords:
        x = coord['x'] * CELLSIZE
        y = coord['y'] * CELLSIZE
        brickRect = pygame.Rect(x, y, CELLSIZE, CELLSIZE)
        pygame.draw.rect(DISPLAYSURF, LIGHTGRAY, brickRect)
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, if you've used any new colours (which you have: <code>LIGHTGRAY</code>), you'll need to define them yourself as we did earlier.  You already know how to do that, so add that code too.</p>

<p>And finally, remember to add the instruction to draw the wall into your main game loop:</p>

<pre><code>    drawApple(apple)
    drawWall(wallCoords)
</code></pre>

<p>The moment of truth.  If you think you've typed it all in correctly, give it a go!</p>
