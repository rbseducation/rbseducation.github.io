Our volunteers have been running Raspberry Pi programming clubs at local schools for 2 years, and over that time, we've come up with lots of great programming exercises that can be completed in about an hour.  A great variety of topics are covered in a fun way, you don't really need any prior programming experience to try them (but a bit of familiarity with your Raspberry Pi helps), and we generally try to avoid anything that requires extra hardware or network connectivity (those aren't always easy to organise in school).
